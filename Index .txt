You have seen the border that surrounds every box i.e. element, the padding 
that can appear inside each box, and the margin that can go around them. In 
this chapter, we will learn how to change the dimensions of boxes.
We have the following properties that allow you to control the dimensions of a 
box.
 The height property is used to set the height of a box.
 The width property is used to set the width of a box.
 The line-height property is used to set the height of a line of text.
 The max-height property is used to set a maximum height that a box can be.
 The min-height property is used to set the minimum height that a box can be.
 The max-width property is used to set the maximum width that a box can be.
 The min-width property is used to set the minimum width that a box can be.
